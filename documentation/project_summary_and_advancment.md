# Project advancement
## Beginning
The project was started with opening my c development environment of choice, which was WSL, creating the test input file, a README.md, a placeholder reverse.c, documentaion folder and checking that everything was up to date and gcc was installed.

After this the repository was pubilshed to GitHub

## code building and testing
Firstly the outline of the project advancement was built by expanding the project summary file.

Secondly I started the coding by implementing features one by one while frequently checking that the edits worked

## Final testing and checking
